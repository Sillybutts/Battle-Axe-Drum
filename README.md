# Battle-Axe-Drum
An abandoned prototype drum for my Battle Axe blaster.


The V1 has a different assembly method vs the V2. I'm not sure which one is better tbh. 


Feel free to finish this project yourself, just give me credit if you make it public. Preferably don't sell it for money.


The solution will probably be to make the mag stem non-centered on the drum bit.
Right now it dips a bit to the right before it coils left-ward
that dip causes the springs to bind up.
If you coiled it instead tangentially from the mag downward bit, it'd work.
Like the Nerf 18 dart snail drums.
You also probably need 4 or 5 drum springs total.
